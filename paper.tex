\abstract{This paper is a reproducibility study of the work in~\cite{glasser2015multi}.}

\section{Introduction}

Groenschild \emph{et al.} first identified the effect of operating
systems on Freesurfer
results~\cite{Gronenschild2012}. In~\cite{10.3389/fninf.2015.00012} we
quantified this effect on some of the main neuroimaging pipelines
including several FSL pipelines, CIVET and Freesurfer. In this work we
aim at evaluating this effect on the work in~\cite{glasser2015multi}.

The operating system is defined here as a consistent set of software
packages organized in a trusted repository.

The operating system is not the only part of the computational
environment that may hamper reproducibility. The work
in~\cite{diethelm2012limits} mentions reproducibility issues coming
from parallelization.

Reproducibility has several other aspects, see, e.g.,

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Dataset}

Data: report on versions and subjects used.

\subsection{Minimal pre-processing pipelines}

Described in~\cite{glasser2013minimal}.

We installed the pipelines in three versions of Linux using Docker
containers. Refer to (immutable) version of containers used. Make sure
the exact same containers are used for all subjects (no rebuild as
rebuild would trigger package update). For each execution, we
monitored the list of packages used with versions.

We integrated the pipelines in CBRAIN through the Boutiques system.

\paragraph{Hardware.} We executed the pipelines on Compute Canada
using the Guillimin cluster of Calcul Qu\'ebec. We monitored the
hardware used (CPU and memory). 

\paragraph{FSL installation.} We developed our own FSL installer to be
able to customize easily the FSL version and build (the script
provided by FSL installs the latest version by default). We used FSL
5.0.6, built for CentOS5 and CentOS6.

\paragraph{Algorithms}
A brief description of the algorithms used in the script for analysis

\paragraph{Softwares and Libraries}
A brief description of the softwares and libraries used

\paragraph{Execution.} The pipeline was launched twice in the same
environment to detect any use of pseudo-random numbers. We
made sure that the results produced by these two executions were
identical.

\subsection{FreeSurfer Docker container}

For the creation of Docker container contianer the FreeSurfer Pipelines, there are a few prerequisites. They are

\begin{itemize}
  \item 64 Bit Operating System (We chose Centos 5, 6 and 7)
  \item FMRIB Software Library(a.k.a FSL) version 5.0.6 (An installation script was developed for this)
  \item Freesurfer version 5.3.0-HCP
  \item Connectome Workbench
\end{itemize}

Out of the images having PreFreeSurfer and environment variables available in Dockerhub(https://hub.docker.com/u/bigdatalabteam/dashboard/), we installed FreeSurfer. FreeSurfer(ftp://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/pub/dist/freesurfer/5.3.0-HCP/freesurfer-Linux-centos4\_x86\_64-stable-pub-v5.3.0-HCP.tar.gz) was used for installation. SetUpFreeSurfer script should be sourced before running the FreeSurferPipelineBatch script. There were a few missing libraries that are added using yum to the base image o f the centos since these libraries are used by FreeSurfer Pipeline. The images which are input to the FreeSurfer should be processed using PreFreeSurfer. FreeSurfer needs a license number which is obtained from the FreeSurfer site and it is essential for smooth functioning of FreeSurfer. 

\subsection{Results comparisons}

Describe the scripts that will be written to compare results.

\section{Results}

Show lists of packages used with version. Focus on important
differences (e.g.: python interpreter, gcc if relevant) and explain
why these packages are important.

Show results of the comparison.

\section{Discussion}

Discuss the results.

\section{Conclusion}

Conclude and highlight future work.
